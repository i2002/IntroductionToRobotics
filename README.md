# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)

This repository contains laboratory homeworks for the Introduction to Robotics course taken at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science (1st semester, 3rd year).

The objective of the course is to learn program a microcontroller and interface it with with hardware inputs and outputs in order to create functional 

The microcontroller used for the homeworks is an [Arduino Uno R3](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3), and the code is written using [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2). Circuit schematics are created using [Circuit Diagram](https://www.circuit-diagram.org/).

Each homework includes all the code and schematics used in solving the homework, as well as code documentation and pictures and videos showcasing the final result.
